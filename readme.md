This is a "Special Edition" of Sibernetic software (original one, for C. elegans simulation, is available here: https://github.com/openworm/sibernetic) aimed at simulation of "virtual tadpole" - X. laevis tadpole 3D biomechanical body model able to swim in water simulated by prediction-correction incompressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (PCISPH).
